### Todo List Lazy

This is a simple to-do list created for practice and to learn programming in C#.

In the `dist` directory, you'll find the to-do list application suitable for your platform.

The program still needs improvements in both architecture and user interface, but it already performs its primary function.

You can use it for your needs as a lightweight and simple terminal-based to-do list.
